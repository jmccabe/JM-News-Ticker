JM News Ticker Changelog

/***************************************************************************/

 version 0.0.1

 * First version. Originally based on Artetics Art News Ticker but reworked to
   be more compliant with Joomla structuring wrt template overrides etc, and to
   take advantage of Joomla 3 field types. Also fixes a few issues that exist
   in the Artetics version, e.g:
   ** the 'reveal' didn't work properly (because the swipe style didn't have a
      background colour set)
   ** links were a bit too simple so the article got shown on the same page
      as the ticker instead of taking you to a different page.
   ** overall improvements in the positioning of elements
